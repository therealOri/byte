# Notes:
> - This will **not** affect image quality or anything else to do with the image. It will be exactly the same to the naked eye.
> - This code does not inject files/images into said image. I may make a seperate file in this repo for that.
> - You need python3 in order to use this. (Very easy to get/install and use)
> - If you want to make this code cleaner, better, more optimized, or add onto the code. Please make a pull request and push your code for me to review.
